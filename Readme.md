# Funny Filters

Hi üññüèΩ this is an **animated funny filter component**, which was made with the aim of training animations and using some libs. The project was made with React Native using **Expo** and **Typescript**

## Functionality
The project's functionality is simple, after you **allow the app to access your camera**, it will detect your face and the default filter is an emoji with a **neutral expression**. For now it only works with 3 types of emoji, if you **blink your right eye** it will show another emoji and if you **smile** it will show a smiling emoji.

## Libs

These are the libs used in the project:
- [Reanimated](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/reanimated/)
- [Face Detector](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/facedetector/)
- [Expo Camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/)

## Open and run the project

Clone this repository with **git clone https://github.com/felipeamodio/Funny-Filters** or download the files, and after that:
- run **yarn** or **npm i** to install all depencencies 
- run expo start
- this project only works with your physical cell phone, so download Expo Go in stores and read the QR-Code with your cell phone that will appear after you run the expo start command in the terminal
